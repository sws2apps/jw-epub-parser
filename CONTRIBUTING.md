SWS Pocket follows semantic versioning. We release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features or non-essential changes, and major versions for any breaking changes. Every significant change is documented in the [changelog](https://github.com/sws2apps/jw-epub-parser/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Bugs

### Known Issues and Report

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sws2apps/jw-epub-parser/issues) to keep track of bugs fix. We keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist.

### Security Bugs

Please do not report security bugs in the public issues; go through the process outlined on the [Security Policy](https://github.com/sws2apps/jw-epub-parser/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Proposing a Change

If you intend to add new features or suggest major changes to JW EPUB Parser, check first that your idea is not yet in our tracking issues list. If not, we recommend creating a new [discussion first](https://github.com/sws2apps/jw-epub-parser/discussions/categories/ideas). This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant effort into it. After it has been approved, please create [new issue](https://github.com/sws2apps/jw-epub-parser/issues), and choose the correct template.

If you’re only fixing a bug, it’s fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend to file an issue detailing what you’re fixing. This is helpful in case we don’t accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.
