# JW EPUB Parser Translation Guide

## Get started

To enhance parsing for a language, make sure first that EPUB is available for that language on jw.org.

1. Open the [JW EPUB Parser](https://crowdin.com/project/cpe-jw-epub-parser) project on Crowdin
2. Find your locale and start translation. Find more details in [guide for volunteer translators](https://support.crowdin.com/for-volunteer-translators/)

All translated and approved content will be pushed to this repo automatically. You don't need to create any PRs with translation.

Original source can be found in [/locales/en](https://github.com/sws2apps/jw-epub-parser/tree/main/src/locales/en). If you find any problem with original source, please create a PR with changes directly to `/locales/en`. Crowdin automatically pull all updates within 1 hour.

### I can't find my language on Crowdin

Please create a [new issue](https://github.com/sws2apps/jw-epub-parser/issues/new?template=new_language_request.yml) in this repo. We would be happy to add the new language so that you can start the translation on Crowdin.
